# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub

I am a jack of all trades master of none, I know a little about a lot, just enough to get myself in trouble.  I work as a network admin/teacher at an independent school in NJ.  I am trying to work on my working knowledge of coding languages such as javascript and swift to hopefully teach in the next school year.  I also just got into 3D printing, mostly working with kids designing with Tinkercad.  I am very familiar with the drag and drop coding activities, like Scratch.  I am also working on trying to fix bugs in a custom app our school had made for us a few years ago that was written in CakePhp.  I have set up a test server on a laptop and am spending a lot of time on that.
